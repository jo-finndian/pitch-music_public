## About The Project

Pitch is an app that creates a playlist based on the music analytics of the people within a specific location (ie. a bar, house) or those invited into a playlist group. The playlist is created by finding the most common musical tastes within the group based on likes, saved playlists, and personal Spotify listening data. The algorithm will then spit out a playlist similarly to how Spotify gives you recommendations. You can set “dynamics” such as moods, genres, ect as well as create playlist constraints like vetoing artists. Users within a playlist group can request songs as well that can be upvoted within the group. 

The app will create a playlist combining each individual user’s Spotify preferences to form a group music profile. Users can set different “dynamics” such as mood, genre, or artists, as well as create playlist constraints, like vetoing artists. Users within a playlist group can also request songs that can be upvoted, or down vote someone else’s. Musical taste collaboration and democratization.
